# SD Card content
This folder contains the files which are required to setup the SD card.

‚ùó Do not directly copy this folder onto your SD card, **it will not work!** The files in the `html` folder only serve as templates. The real `html` folder get generated using the Github actions. Instead, you can use any of the artifacts generaded in any of the Pipeline runs of the [Build-Pipeline](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/actions/workflows/build.yaml).
